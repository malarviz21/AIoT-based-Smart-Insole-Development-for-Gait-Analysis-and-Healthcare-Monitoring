AIoT based Smart Insole Development for Healthcare Monitoring – Master’s Project	at NUS, Singapore

This project focuses on developing a smart insole equipped with advanced biosensors to monitor plantar pressure in real time, addressing the critical need for correct posture during exercise. Improper exercise posture not only diminishes the effectiveness of physical activity but can also lead to injury. By continuously tracking pressure distribution across the foot, the smart insole will provide users with detailed feedback on their weight distribution, gait patterns, and overall posture. The system is designed to detect improper movements during exercise and offer immediate corrective guidance, helping users adjust their posture to prevent injuries and optimize performance.
In addition to posture correction, the insole will analyse users' gaits, offering insights valuable for both injury prevention and performance improvement, particularly in rehabilitation and sports training contexts. Furthermore, the wearable design enables continuous real-time monitoring, making it ideal for everyday use in applications such as sports injury prevention, rehabilitation, and early diagnostics. The project will also integrate the smart insole with VR/AR systems, where the precise real-time data it collects on movement and gait can be used for accurate control and interaction within virtual environments, enhancing the immersive experience. Overall, the smart insole aims to improve exercise efficiency, promote injury prevention, and extend its benefits to advanced applications in wearable technology and virtual reality.
